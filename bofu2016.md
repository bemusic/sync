# BOFU2016 Unofficial Sync Project

This project aims to distribute BOFU2016 packages with synchronization technology, using [Resilio Sync](https://getsync.com/individuals/).
Using Sync, we can release the package early.
As more songs are published, they are added to the distribution and synchronized to everyone!


## How to download?

1. __Go to this link:__

   <p align="center"><a href="https://link.getsync.com/#f=BOFU2016&amp;sz=1E3&amp;t=2&amp;s=VI5S7SMEBYU6U3JDQ4VAFDPFNZN7QPRJFAWKM7VPYK3IPEKJOOBQ&amp;i=C74NODHHLLSFOOGFZKASEAOV2UQLEJGNN&amp;v=2.4" class="dl">Synchronize Package</a></p>

   You will be asked to install Resilio Sync.

2. __If you don’t have Resilio Sync,__ please install it.

   The company “Resilio, Inc.” was [spun out of BitTorrent, Inc.](https://getsync.com/about/), the owner of μTorrent.
   Resilio Sync allows folders to be synchronized using peer-to-peer technology.
